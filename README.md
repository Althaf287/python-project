# ABC Company Dataset Analysis
This project involves analyzing a dataset from an ABC company to gather insights into employee distribution, salary expenditure, and correlations between age and salary. The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and processed to answer various analytical questions using Python and popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Project Steps
### Step 1: Download and Load the Dataset
Download the ABC Company dataset in CSV format and load it into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.
### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Fixing the "Height" Column: Replace the 'height' column values with random numbers between 150 and 180.
Handling Missing Values: Check for missing data and drop any rows with missing values to ensure clean data for analysis.
### Step 3: Analysis Tasks
Employee Distribution by Team: Calculate the number and percentage of employees in each team.
Segregate Employees by Position: Group employees based on their job position within the company.
Identify Predominant Age Group: Create age ranges and determine the most common age group among employees.
Find Team/Position with Highest Salary Expenditure: Identify the team and position with the highest salary expenditures.
Correlation Between Age and Salary: Investigate the relationship between employees' ages and their salaries.
### Step 4: Graphical Representations
Employee Distribution Across Teams: Create a bar chart to visualize the number of employees in each team.
Segregation by Position: Create a bar chart to display the number of employees in each position.
Age Group Distribution: Create a bar chart to visualize the number of employees in each age group.
Salary Expenditure by Team and Position: Visualize the total salary expenditure for each team and position using bar charts.
Correlation Between Age and Salary: Visualize the relationship between age and salary using a scatter plot.
## Libraries Used
- * 'pandas' : For data manipulation and analysis.
#### numpy: For numerical operations and generating random values.
#### matplotlib: For data visualization.
#### seaborn: For advanced statistical plots and visualizations.
## How to Run the Project
#### Clone the repository to your local machine.
#### Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

#### Download the dataset and save it as a .csv file.
#### Update the path to the CSV file in the code.
#### Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the analysis and visualizations.
## Conclusion
This project provides insights into employee distribution, salary expenditure, and the correlation between age and salary at ABC Company. The visualizations help in understanding the data better and can guide decision-making in areas like team management, salary planning, and workforce demographics.
